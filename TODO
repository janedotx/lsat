create controller action to serve up one day of work, with video
generate a test for each day, basically...
add a column to LsatTest for user_id

each question should know which prep test it came from
and the cost of that prep test
so we know how much it costs for a 'copy' of that question

FIRST
grade the fucking test by section

Farther away
make things pretty
fix CSRF stuff
I seem to remember PNGs are better than other image files
use images

vocab test

set up apache


a user has a collection of lessons
some lessons can be reused and won't be just for one user
a lesson is some videos, questions, and some games and such (don't know how games would be represented in the model quite yet), and a reading assignment
so a lesson should have a lsat test (or tests)
