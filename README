we 0 index in all code, but for display purposes it's always 1-indexed.

using digital color picker's hex values:
red: 9a3d36
green: 728c47

using colorpicker.com, this is my best approximation:
red: CC443D
green: 729149

red: a1453a

xred: 9a3d36

a training program == a collection of lessons (LessonsCollection)
a lesson is:
  - an LsatTest
  - videos associated with the questions on the LsatTest (each question will know whether it has a video or not and where the video is)
  - vocabulary test for the day
  - focus game for the day
  - reading for the day
  - other videos/explanations for the day.

probably a limited number of lessons total. LessonsCollections will just be various permutations of all possible lesson ids.

depending on how they do on the diagnostic test, we will change how the training program looks. 
how to indicate an LsatTest specializes on something?
actually should indicate lesson focus
