This is your score, by section:

<br/>
<br/>
<%# you shouldn't be doing this in the view, silly %>
<% @percentages.each_pair do |key, answers| %>
  <%= make_presentable(key) %>: <%= answers * 100 %>%
  <br/>
<br/>
<% end %>

<p>
Now that we've calculated your score, you can start working your way through our study schedule! <%= link_to "Begin", lesson_of_the_day_path %>
